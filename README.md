## Overview

I managed to finish the Newsletter challenge using NetxJS and TailwindCSS. All of the requirements are in, just the placement of the validation message is different.

Maybe I would have liked to include variables in the Form component (maybe the texts?) so it could work with whatever text you want and you could reuse it across all the website. Also I added a change in opacity of the button when it's not "clickable".

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
